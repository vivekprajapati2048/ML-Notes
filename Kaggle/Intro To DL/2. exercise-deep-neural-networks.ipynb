Sometimes though you'll want to put some other layer between the `Dense` layer and its activation function. (We'll see an example of this in Lesson 5 with *batch normalization*.) In this case, we can define the activation in its own `Activation` layer, like so:\n\n```\nlayers.Dense(units=8),\nlayers.Activation('relu')\n```\n\nThis is completely equivalent to the ordinary way: `layers.Dense(units=8, activation='relu')`.\n\nRewrite the following model so that each activation is in its own `Activation` layer."},{"metadata":{"lines_to_next_cell":0,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"### YOUR CODE HERE: rewrite this to use activation layers\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    layers.Dense(32, input_shape=[8]),\n    layers.Activation('relu'),\n    layers.Dense(32),\n    layers.Activation('relu'),\n    layers.Dense(1),\n])\n\n# Check your answer\nq_3.check()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_3.hint()\n#q_3.solution()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Optional: Alternatives to ReLU #\n\nThere is a whole family of variants of the `'relu'` activation -- `'elu'`, `'selu'`, and `'swish'`, among others -- all of which you can use in Keras. Sometimes one activation will perform better than another on a given task, so you could consider experimenting with activations as you develop a model. The ReLU activation tends to do well on most problems, so it's a good one to start with.\n\nLet's look at the graphs of some of these. Change the activation from `'relu'` to one of the others named above. Then run the cell to see the graph.
